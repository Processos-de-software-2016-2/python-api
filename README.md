# About the project

The project is a platform in which the users will be able to exchange knowledge through it. You can learn from playing the guitar to the basics of a programming language, in which there will be a knowledge exchange, meaning that since you will be teaching someone else, it is expected that you too will be learning from your study partner.

This platform is being developed by all participants in the Processos de Software course at UFRN.
